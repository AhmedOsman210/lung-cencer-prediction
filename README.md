# Cancer Patient Data Classification

This project focuses on classifying cancer patient data using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features related to patients' health, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The goal is to predict the severity of the patient's condition based on these features.

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies cancer patients based on their health conditions, lifestyle habits, and environmental exposure. The dataset contains various features such as age, gender, smoking habits, air pollution, and others. We use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification, and we evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- `Alcohol use`
- `Dust Allergy`
- `Air Pollution`
- `Smoking`
- `Obesity`
- `Occupational Hazards`
- `Genetic Risk`
- `Fatigue`
- `Chronic Lung Disease`
- `Level` (target variable: Low, Medium, High)

### Data Source

- [Add source link if available]

## Model

In this project, the following machine learning model is used:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A classification model that works well for binary and multi-class classification tasks.

The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%. The performance of the model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
Usage
After installing the required dependencies, you can run the cancer_patient_classification.py script to train and test the model. The script will output the classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy score.

To run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python cancer_patient_classification.py
